Q/ Routes on User/users is quite verbose
Q/ Same way new post is storing author name so don't have to look thru all

Q/ Adding follower id array to window, and everywhere else to ensure current user always has follows? Or better yet, checking profile visited if current user is a follower?
Q/ When removing maintain state across all inputs?
